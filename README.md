# presandsation

A presenter software for talks and lectures that allows combing various inputs. 
The name presandsation stands for press and sensation and represents the hope that you will impress your audience with the simple click of a button. 

In its first iteration, the code should be able to automatically stop video presentations at specific pause points and allow easily jumping back and forth between these set pause points.  
This should be suited to present videos like those created using [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) live in front of an audience. 

Later on, more modules could be added to allow presenting pdfs from e.g. [beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer) via a simple python script.
